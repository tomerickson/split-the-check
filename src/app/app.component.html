          <p>How often has this happened to you:</p>
          <p>
            It's 11:30 in the morning, and you're starting to think about lunch.&ensp;When you make the mistake of
            saying "I'm
            hungry" heads start popping up above the cubicle walls like prairie dogs at a coyote convention.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pretty soon your co-workers are swarming your cube, waving menus and twenty-dollar bills, shouting orders,
            condiment
            choices, special dietary requirements, and food preparation instructions.&ensp;Since you opened your mouth
            first,
            you're elected to take
            the delivery order, account for the money, phone it in, get all the condiments and preparation instructions
            straight, and make change for all the twenties.&ensp;And what thanks do you get for your efforts?&ensp;Harry
            orders
            a 4.75 burger, drops
            a five, winks and says "Forget the change."
          </p>
          <p>
            When it's all over you're out five bucks because nobody accounted for tax and tip.</p>
          <p>You can't make your co-workers any less boorish, but you can make your life easier by using the "Split the
            Check"
            lunch order form below.</p>
